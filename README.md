The employment data of Wales from the StatsWales data source are taken as our requirement as we have all the industry employed workers year wise. To do so first we downloaded all required datasets in require form then apply some preprocessing techniques to make a dataset which is feasible for our computation. We got our dataset as it contains total of 11 columns (Industry, 2009, 2010, 2011â€¦. 2018) and 10 rows (Each industry - 'Agriculture','Production','Construction','Retail','ICT','Finance','Real_Estate','Professional_Service','Public_Adminstration','Other_Service').
